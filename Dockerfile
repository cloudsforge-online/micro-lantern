# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Build context is this repository, plus two named contexts for the unpublished sibling packages:
#
#   docker build -t lantern \
#     --build-context runtimepkgs=../runtime \
#     --build-context contractspkgs=../contracts .
#
# `contractspkgs` arrived with wave M1b: the absorbed analytics module reads
# `@cloudsforge/contracts-events` for `verifyDelivery`, which is what makes its inbox refuse a body
# that was altered between a producer's outbox and the handler. It is not optional — without it the
# image fails at the first COPY.
#
# Both extra contexts are temporary. Once the @cloudsforge/* packages are published (AD-02),
# package.json takes registry versions, the COPY lines marked below are deleted, the flags go away,
# and this becomes an ordinary single-context build.
#
# They are named `runtimepkgs`/`contractspkgs` rather than `runtime`/`contracts` because a build
# context and a build stage share one namespace, and the final stage below is called `runtime`.

# Pin pnpm in the image. The sibling workspaces are installed before this service's own package.json
# is copied, so corepack has no packageManager field to read at that point and would otherwise grab
# whatever is latest and then refuse to switch to the 11.9.0 the siblings pin.

# Temporary: the `link:` dependencies resolve to ../runtime and ../contracts relative to this
# directory, so the packages must exist at those paths inside the image for the lockfile to stay
# frozen. `link:` in particular resolves at install time to the sibling's own node_modules.

# Install the siblings' OWN dependencies first. `link:` uses the sibling as-is and does not manage
# its dependency tree, so /runtime's and /contracts' node_modules must exist independently — both
# for `tsc` to resolve the sibling source it typechecks (jose, @opentelemetry/api) and for
# `node --import tsx` to load @cloudsforge/* at run time. Without this the image builds a set of
# @cloudsforge symlinks that point at source which cannot resolve its own imports.

# `--frozen-lockfile` is the point of the step: a build that silently resolves a different
# dependency tree from the one CI tested is a build whose provenance means nothing.

# build instead of the first request.

# without the targets the links dangle and the first `import '@cloudsforge/db'` fails at run time.

# Every value in `src/env.ts` and `src/analytics/env.ts` is supplied by the deploy at run time.
# There is no ENV line here on purpose — least of all `LANTERN_TOKEN`, which gates /metrics, and
# least of all `ANALYTICS_PSEUDONYM_KEY`. Every other secret in the estate answers "can an attacker
# act as us". The pepper answers "was the pseudonymisation ever real": with it and a candidate user
# id, anyone can compute a lookup key and learn whether that person is in the store, and while
# their salt exists, recover their behavioural history. An image layer is copied to every registry
# mirror that ever pulled the tag, and a layer cannot be rotated. `.dockerignore` excludes `.env`,
# `.env.*` and `.git` for the same reason.

# The health endpoints are for the orchestrator, not for the image: the balancer probes /readyz and

# then drifts.

# The migrator is a SEPARATE one-shot process — `node --import tsx src/migrator.ts` — run as an
# init container or a Kubernetes Job before this ever starts. Since wave M1b that one command
# migrates BOTH modules' databases, sequentially, and refuses outright if the two point at one
# database (see src/migratortargets.ts). It is deliberately not invoked here: below SCHEMA_VERSION
# the `issues_resolved_has_time`/`issues_regressed_has_time` CHECKs, the trace-id shape guards and
# analytics' four privacy constraints may not exist, and a service that could create them at boot
# is a service that could start without them. The composition root asserts both schema versions and
# refuses to serve below either.
