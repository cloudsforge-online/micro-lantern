/**
 * The HTTP surface: what this module depends on, and the one line that mounts it alone.
 *
 * Plain `node:http`, following the service template. The parts that matter — request ids, RED
 * metrics, the child logger, the error shape, the auth-fault mapping — are framework-independent.
 *
 * This file used to be all three of those things at once. It is now the composition point:
 *
 *   - `../kernel.ts` owns the request listener — the plumbing this module and lantern had each
 *     written for themselves, line for line the same. Wave M1b deleted this directory's copy;
 *     there is one kernel now and it serves both route tables.
 *   - `routes.ts` owns the route table, the error classes and the failure mapping, built by a
 *     factory over `ServerDeps` so every handler CLOSES OVER its dependencies instead of being
 *     handed them. That is the seam wave M1 of `deploy/docs/service-merge-plan.md` needed, and the
 *     reason is written out in that file's header: it is what keeps this module's pseudonymisation
 *     pepper out of scope for the route set mounted beside it.
 *   - This file keeps the dependency contract (`ServerDeps`, `PrincipalVerifier`), the scope
 *     vocabulary, the metric declarations, and `createServer`.
 *
 * `createServer(deps)` is unchanged in signature, in export and in behaviour. **It is not what the
 * merged process runs** — `module.ts` builds the routes and lantern's `createMergedServer` mounts
 * them — but it is what `server.test.ts` drives, and a module that could not still be stood up
 * alone would be one nobody could test or reason about alone.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **THERE IS NO ROUTE THAT WRITES AN EVENT FROM A BROWSER.**
 *
 * AD-21: analytics is fed by the event bus, not by a page tag. `POST /ingest` takes a signed event
 * envelope from a producer's outbox relay, and that is the only write path for an event. A
 * collector endpoint a browser could reach would bypass the delivery signature and — because a
 * browser has no way to know a pepper — the pseudonymisation as well. The frontend events AD-21
 * names (`page_viewed`, `cta_clicked`, `form_abandoned`) reach this service the same way every
 * other event does: through their own service's outbox.
 *
 * `/ingest` authenticates with the delivery MAC and reads no bearer token; the route in `routes.ts`
 * records why at length, and why that is not a weakening. Every OTHER route on this service demands
 * a bearer, and the scope matcher for those is the exact one described below.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE SCOPE MATCHER: EXACT, DELIBERATELY, AND NEITHER PACKAGE IS CHANGED.**
 *
 * 18-build-status.md §3.3h records that the estate ships two scope matchers that disagree:
 * `contracts/packages/auth/src/index.ts` is `granted.includes(required)` — exact only — and
 * `runtime/packages/auth/src/index.ts` honours one wildcard level, so `analytics:*` grants
 * `analytics:read`. Both are shipped, both are CI-green, and §3.3h leaves the disagreement open on
 * purpose because changing an authorisation matcher is the highest-blast-radius edit in this
 * estate.
 *
 * This service therefore changes neither package and matches **exactly**, in `hasExactScope` below
 * — the same choice `micro-devplatform` and `micro-admin-api` made, and made for a reason that
 * applies here with more force. A wildcard grants scopes that did not exist when the credential
 * was issued. In a service that holds four hundred days of behaviour, that means a token minted to
 * read a funnel silently acquires whatever read is added next — and the next one might be the
 * cohort export. `hasScope` from `@cloudsforge/auth` is deliberately not imported, and
 * `server.test.ts` asserts that about THIS FILE — which is why the matcher stays here rather than
 * moving to `routes.ts` with its callers.
