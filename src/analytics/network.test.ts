/**
 * The network boundary, pinned.
 *
 * analytics serves BOTH estates from one process since the network consolidation (micro-deploy
 * `docs/network-consolidation.md`). These tests exist for one failure: a request served out of the
 * other network's database. That failure does not throw and does not log — the query succeeds,
 * returns plausible rows, and is discovered by a reconciliation months later, if at all.
 *
 * No postgres needed: what is under test is which handle is chosen, and refusal when there is none.

   *
   * `POST /ingest` called `ingest(deps.ingest, delivery)`. `deps.ingest.sql` is the process-wide
   * PRIMARY handle, fixed at boot by `index.ts`; `ctx.sql` is what `networkSql` resolves from
   * `CF-Network` once per request. So a delivery stamped `testnet` was written into the mainnet
   * database, silently, with a 200.
   *
   * The behavioural tests above cannot see it: they assert what happens when a network is UNKNOWN
   * or ABSENT, and this route resolved a network correctly and then ignored it. The only
   * distinguishing evidence is which handle the write went through, which is a fact about the
   * source rather than about a response.
   *
   * Hence a source assertion. It is narrow on purpose — it does not try to prove every handler is
   * correct, only that no handler passes the boot-time handle where the per-request one belongs.
   *
   * It reads `routes.ts` rather than `server.ts` since wave M1a moved the route table there
   * (`createRoutes`). The file moved; the assertions did not change. Both cases must keep naming
   * whichever file declares the handlers — a source assertion pointed at a file the routes have
   * left passes vacuously, which is worse than not having one.
   *
   * Wave M1b moved the module into `micro-lantern/src/analytics/`, and this file moved WITH
   * `routes.ts`, so the relative URL below still resolves to the file that declares the handlers.
   * Both cases were re-measured across the move and still match the same two lines.
   *
   * The merge added a SECOND way for a handler to get the wrong database, and it is answered in the
   * same place: `RouteSpec.sql`. The kernel resolves one handle per request from one selector, and
   * in a two-module process the host's selector is lantern's — so these routes carry their own,
   * stamped once over the whole table in `module.ts`. `micro-lantern/src/merged.test.ts` drives
   * that against both real databases; without it, `select … from events` here reads lantern's
   * identically-named table.
