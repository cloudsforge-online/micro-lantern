/**
 * The metric catalogue: versioned, checksummed, and unable to change under a chart.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **A REDEFINITION CREATES A NEW ID. IT NEVER EDITS AN OLD ONE.**
 *
 * 13-operational-model.md states the rule and the reason in one sentence: "a retention number
 * that changed definition in March is a chart that lies about February". Definitions are versioned
 * *in this repository*, which is what :636 asks for, and the database holds a checksum over the
 * numerator, the denominator and the window of every version ever published.
 *
 * `publish()` is therefore not an upsert. Publishing `(id, version)` whose checksum differs from
 * the one already stored **throws**, and the `metric_definitions` trigger refuses the UPDATE that
 * would paper over it. The only way to change what a metric means is to add a version — which
 * leaves the old series intact, with the definition it was computed under still readable beside it.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every entry carries numerator, denominator and window, because 13-operational-model.md says
 * "every metric states numerator, denominator and window" and a metric that does not is a number
 * two people will read differently. The `metric` field cites the row in 13 §12 it implements.
 *
 * This is a SUBSET of the twenty in 13 §12, and the gap is honest rather than hidden: metrics 3,
 * 4, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14 name events (`identity.email.verified`, `wallet.address.assigned`,
 * `mint.order.created`, `trade.bot.started`, `worlds.session.started`, `membership.joined`,
 * `proposal.voted`) that `contracts-events` does not register — eighteen topics, checked at
 * `contracts/packages/events/src/index.ts`. A definition for a metric whose input event
 * cannot be emitted would be a definition that silently reports zero for ever, which is worse than
 * its absence. They are listed in the README as the work this service is waiting on.
