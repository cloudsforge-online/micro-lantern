/**
 * The database harness, and the small fakes.
 *
 * **A database test runs only against a database whose name says it is a test database.**
 *
 * Not a convenience: `resetAnalytics` truncates every table this service owns, and requiring
 * "test" in the name is the difference between a red build and an emptied environment.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE VARIABLE IS `ANALYTICS_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, SPELLED EXACTLY.**
 *
 * The reusable workflow at `cloudsforge-online/micro-org/.github/workflows/service-ci.yml` exports
 * the CI Postgres DSN under `<SERVICE>_TEST_DATABASE_URL` and then GREPS the test output for a skip
 * — if the database-backed suite skipped, the build FAILS rather than going green on nothing. A
 * different spelling here reads no DSN, skips silently, and turns that guard into the exact
 * false-green it exists to prevent. So the name is not negotiable and is asserted by `env.test.ts`.
