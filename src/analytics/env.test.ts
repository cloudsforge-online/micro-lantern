 * actually shipped — `estate-only-…` and `estate-placeholder-…` — and they cleared the old floors
 * for the same reason those did: the floor counted keystrokes. So this suite was asserting that a
 * hyphenated placeholder is an acceptable PEPPER, which is the variable this service's own header
 * calls the most consequential in the estate.
 *
 * Regenerated per run rather than replaced with better-looking literals, so a placeholder cannot
 * creep back in the next time somebody needs a fixture.
