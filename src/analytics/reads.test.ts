/**
 * The analysis surface, and the threshold in front of it.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS THAT A COHORT OF ONE IS THAT PERSON.**
 *
 * Everything else in this repository protects the STORE: the pepper, the salt, the property
 * allowlist and the four CHECK constraints. None of them protects the ANSWERS. "One user in the
 * 1k–10k bucket deposited on Tuesday" is a statement about one person, whatever the subject column
 * holds, and anybody who knows who registered on Tuesday has just read their behaviour.
 *
 * So every count that leaves `reads.ts` passes `suppress()`, and this file proves it in both
 * directions on every path — the daily series, the active count, each funnel step independently,
 * and both halves of a retention cell. Testing only that a small count is withheld would pass
 * against a function that withheld everything, so each case also plants a cohort at the threshold
 * and asserts the number IS returned. A suppression that suppresses everything is an outage, and an
 * outage is what gets a privacy guard switched off.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The numbers are deliberately chosen around `minCohort = 5`: four is withheld, five is published,
 * and zero is published as zero. Zero is not a disclosure — "nobody did this" says nothing about
 * anybody — and suppressing it would make an empty funnel indistinguishable from a busy one, which
 * is precisely how an operator ends up lowering the threshold to find out which it was.

   *
   * These cases used to plant a registration at `Date.now() - 21 * DAY`, its activity a day later,
   * and then call a `retentionGrid` that anchored its twelve-week cutoff on SQL `now()`. Twenty-one
   * days is exactly three weeks, so the registration always landed on whatever weekday the suite
   * happened to run on — and `date_trunc('week', …)` cuts on a **Monday, in the database's
   * timezone**. When the run fell on a Sunday in UTC, the registration sat in one ISO week and the
   * activity a day later sat in the next: `week_offset` came out 1, there was no week-0 cell at
   * all, and `assert.ok(week0)` failed. (Running at 01:00 in a UTC+3 office was enough to do it on
   * a local Monday.)
   *
   * The other six days it passed — and passed **without ever having established that the offset was
   * computed**, because a grid that filed every cell at offset 0 would have satisfied it just as
   * well. A wall-clock test is not merely red on some future Tuesday; it is green for the wrong
   * reason in between.
   *
   * The fix is that time is an argument (`reads.ts`'s `Now`) and every fixture timestamp is derived
   * from that same pinned instant via `weekStart()`, never from `Date.now()`. Fixture and window
   * cannot drift apart because they are the same number. The block then runs under three pinned
   * instants — including the exact Sunday that used to break it — and asserts identical results, so
   * any surviving dependence on the wall clock shows up as a disagreement between them.
