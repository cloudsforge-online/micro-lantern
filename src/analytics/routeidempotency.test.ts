/**
 * Every mutating route either replays a retry or has a documented reason not to.
 *
 * **WHY THIS IS A SOURCE-LEVEL TEST**, copied from `market/src/routeidempotency.test.ts` along with
 * the defect it was written for. In `market`, `POST /v1/orders/:id/disputes` was a plain INSERT with
 * no natural key and no route wrapper, so a double-clicked button opened TWO disputes on one order
 * and froze the listing twice. It sat beside four sibling routes that wrapped correctly and nothing
 * noticed, because the domain tests called `openDispute` directly and never traversed the route.
 *
 * The defect is an OMISSION, and an omission has no behaviour to test. So this asserts the shape of
 * the file: a mutating route added tomorrow without a wrapper fails here, and its author must either
 * wrap it or write down why it does not need one.
 *
 * The check is by ENUMERATION rather than by a list of routes somebody remembered to update — the
 * list is derived from the route table itself, and the last three cases exist so that a detector
 * which has stopped seeing routes fails loudly instead of passing vacuously.
 *
 * **It reads `routes.ts`.** Wave M1a moved the table out of `server.ts` into `createRoutes()`;
 * this file followed it, unchanged in what it asserts. The last three cases are what make that
 * safe to do: a detector left pointing at the old file finds zero routes and every other case in
 * here passes over an empty list, which is precisely the vacuous green they exist to prevent —
 * and is exactly what they caught during that move.
 *
 * **Wave M1b moved the whole module into `micro-lantern/src/analytics/`, and this file moved WITH
 * `routes.ts`**, so the relative URL below still names the file that declares the handlers. The
 * count was measured on both sides of the move and is unchanged: **14 routes, 3 of them mutating**.
 * That number is recorded here rather than asserted exactly, because the floor below is a floor and
 * tightening it to an equality would fail the next route somebody adds for a reason that has
 * nothing to do with idempotency.
 *
 * Note also what did NOT change: `createRoutes` still declares `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics`.
 * The merged process does not MOUNT them — one listener serves one of each, lantern's — but they
 * are filtered out at the seam (`module.ts`'s `mountableRoutes`) rather than deleted here, so this
 * detector still sees the same table it always did.
