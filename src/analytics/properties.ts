 * The property boundary. Nothing a person typed gets past this file.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THIS SERVICE NEVER READS A PRODUCER'S DOMAIN PAYLOAD.**
 *
 * That is the single most important sentence in this repository after the one about the pepper.
 *
 * `wallet.deposit.confirmed` carries an address and an exact amount. `market.listing.sold` carries
 * a listing title a seller typed. `identity.user.registered` carries a handle. Every one of those
 * is in the envelope this service receives, and not one of them is ever looked at: `sanitise`
 * reads `payload.analytics` — the **analytics envelope**, the object a producer opts in to sending
 * — and nothing else in the payload exists as far as this service is concerned.
 *
 * The alternative design, mapping each topic's domain payload onto analytics properties, would put
 * a per-topic function in front of a listing title and rely on that function to be careful. Twenty
 * producers, eighteen topics and a changelog later, one of those functions passes a name through.
 * 16-risks-and-open-decisions.md names the review trigger as "any PR adding a field to the
 * analytics envelope", which is a trigger that only means something if the envelope is a real,
 * separate, opt-in object — so it is one.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Within the analytics envelope, every key must be in `PROPERTIES` and every value must satisfy
 * its declared type. A key that is not, or a value that does not, is **dropped and counted** —
 * 11-data-and-contract-strategy.md: "the ingest path rejects an event carrying any of those
 * keys rather than dropping the key silently". The producer is told which keys were refused in the
 * response to its own signed delivery; the database records a count by reason and topic and never
 * the key itself, because a key can be the personal data (`{"spiros_lives_at": 1}`) just as easily
 * as a value can.
 *
 * The event is still stored when a property is refused. Refusing the whole event would mean a
 * producer that added one field lost every funnel it feeds, which is the pressure that gets a
 * privacy guard turned off.
