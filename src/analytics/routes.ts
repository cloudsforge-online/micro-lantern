/**
 * The analytics route table, and everything only these routes may see.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **THERE IS NO ROUTE HERE THAT WRITES AN EVENT FROM A BROWSER.**
 *
 * AD-21: analytics is fed by the event bus, not by a page tag. `POST /ingest` takes a signed event
 * envelope from a producer's outbox relay, and that is the only write path for an event. A
 * collector endpoint a browser could reach would bypass the delivery signature and — because a
 * browser has no way to know a pepper — the pseudonymisation as well. The frontend events AD-21
 * names (`page_viewed`, `cta_clicked`, `form_abandoned`) reach this service the same way every
 * other event does: through their own service's outbox.
 *
 * `/ingest` authenticates with the delivery MAC and reads no bearer token; the route below records
 * why at length, and why that is not a weakening. Every OTHER route here demands a bearer, and the
 * scope matcher for those is `hasExactScope` in `server.ts` — exact, deliberately, for the reason
 * that file's header records at length.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **WHY `createRoutes(deps)` IS A FACTORY, AND WHY `handle` LOST ITS `deps` PARAMETER.**
 *
 * Every handler below CLOSES OVER `deps`. None receives it. The shape it replaces —
 * `handle: (ctx, deps) => …` — put the whole service's dependency record in the signature of the
 * route type, which is fine while one process serves one service and stops being fine in wave M1
 * of `deploy/docs/service-merge-plan.md`: lantern and analytics become one process mounting both
 * route tables on one listener. Under `handle(ctx, deps)` the listener must hand every handler the
 * same `deps`, so lantern's OTLP handler would be one property access from
 * `deps.ingest.peppers` — the pseudonymisation pepper ring that is the whole reason a subject in
 * this store cannot be re-identified, including by us.
 *
 * The plan promises that the privacy boundary "survives as a module boundary instead of a process
 * boundary". This factory is that boundary, made out of scope rather than out of a convention: the
 * pepper is reachable only from inside this function, and what another module cannot name it
 * cannot pass to a logger, a metric label or an error body by accident.

       *
       * This handler used to call `authenticate()` and demand an `analytics:ingest` scope before
       * it read a byte. **No producer in this estate could ever satisfy it.** Every outbox relay
       * sends exactly two headers — the delivery signature and the event id — and nothing else;
       * `identity/src/outbox.ts` is the canonical one, and all twenty-one relays in the estate
       * were checked, not assumed. A relay is a background job woken by a Postgres poll: it has no
       * session, no user, and no way to mint a token. So every event bound for this service died
       * 401 at this line, always, and the onboarding denominator every funnel metric divides by
       * stayed empty while the service reported itself healthy.
       *
       * That was measured against the running estate before it was changed: a correctly signed
       * `POST /ingest` carrying no `Authorization` header answered
       * `401 {"code":"unauthenticated"}`.
       *
       * **Why removing it does not weaken anything.** The two checks were never redundant, but
       * they were also never both obtainable. A bearer proves *who* opened the socket and proves
       * nothing about the bytes; the MAC proves the bytes were produced by something holding the
       * estate's outbox signing secret, which is a strictly stronger statement about the thing
       * that actually matters here — the content of the row. A signed-in person still cannot reach
       * this route, because a person does not hold that secret. `micro-notify` (`server.ts`)
       * and `micro-activity` made this exact repair for this exact reason; `trade` and `worlds`
       * shaped their inboxes this way from the start.
       *
       * The `analytics:ingest` scope constant was DELETED rather than left unreferenced — a scope
       * that no route checks is a capability the vocabulary claims and does not have.
       * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
       *
       * The order below is the security property: read the raw bytes, verify the signature over
       * exactly those bytes, and only then parse. Parsing first would put a parser in front of the
       * authentication, reachable by anyone who can open a socket.
       *
       * It is deliberately NOT wrapped in `withIdempotency`: the inbox, unique on
       * `(topic, event_id)`, is a stronger guarantee than a caller-supplied key, because it works
       * for a relay that has forgotten it already delivered. `routeidempotency.test.ts` records
