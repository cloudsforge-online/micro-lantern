/**
 * Configuration, validated at import.
 *
 * Rule 9 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2 — "a repo declares the variables it needs; the deploy provides
 * exactly those" — is a property of this file. Every variable this service reads is named here and
 * nowhere else.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **`ANALYTICS_PSEUDONYM_KEY` IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL VARIABLE IN THIS ESTATE, AND IT IS
 * REQUIRED, LONG, AND NEVER DEFAULTED.**
 *
 * Every other secret in the estate answers "can an attacker act as us". This one answers "was the
 * pseudonymisation ever real". With the pepper and a candidate user id, an attacker can compute a
 * lookup key and learn whether that person is in the store — and, while their salt still exists,
 * recover their entire four-hundred-day behavioural history. R-37 in
 * 16-risks-and-open-decisions.md is exactly this risk and names it as the reason the boundary is
 * enforced in code.
 *
 * So there is no default, no development fallback, and no "unset means off" mode. A service that
 * started with a weak or absent pepper would produce a store that looks pseudonymised and is not,
 * which is worse than one that refuses to start.
 *
 * **THE CHECK IS NO LONGER ON LENGTH, AND THAT SENTENCE USED TO BE THIS FILE'S BIGGEST LIE.** It
 * said "the check is on length, which is the only proxy available here" and asked for 32
 * characters. Measured out of `cloudsforge-estate-analytics-1` on 2026-08-05, the pepper this
 * estate is running is 40 characters, hyphenated, and normalises to a string containing
 * `estateonly` — micro-org #142 and #189 in the same value, on the one variable this header calls
 * the most consequential in the estate, and the 32-character floor passed it without a word.
 * `@cloudsforge/secrets` asserts the SHAPE instead: base64 or hex, 32 decoded BYTES rather than 32
 * keystrokes, a measured entropy floor, and no placeholder marker anywhere in the value.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The minimum-cohort threshold has a FLOOR rather than a range. The deploy may raise it; it may
 * not lower it below five. A configurable suppression threshold that can be set to 1 is not a
 * suppression threshold, it is a suggestion, and the one number in this service that protects a
 * person from being the only member of a cohort should not be weakenable by an environment
 * variable somebody set while debugging a dashboard.
 *
 * Two behaviours are copied deliberately from the siblings:
 *
 *   1. **A missing variable names itself.** `undefined` propagating into a connection string
 *      surfaces four layers later as an unreadable driver error.
 *   2. **A known placeholder is refused outright.** A default secret in source is not convenient,
 *      it is catastrophic, and a placeholder that boots is a placeholder that reaches production.

 * Measured out of `cloudsforge-estate-analytics-1` on 2026-08-05:
 *
 *   ANALYTICS_TOKEN          41 characters, hyphenated, normalises to contain `placeholder`
 *   ANALYTICS_PSEUDONYM_KEY  40 characters, hyphenated, normalises to contain `estateonly`

 * The token's compose line is `${ANALYTICS_TOKEN:-estate-placeholder-token-0000000000000000}`, so a
 * deploy CAN override it and has not, on either estate, on two lines each. The pepper arrives from
 * `secrets/analytics-pepper.<network>.env` and is the value #189 exists about.
 *
 * A check that cannot fail is worse than no check, because the absence of an alarm gets read as the
 * absence of a problem. Both floors were long enough to look like diligence and short enough to
 * pass every placeholder anybody wrote — 41 > 24 and 40 > 32.
 *
 * A deny-list of exact strings is structurally unable to work: the next placeholder somebody writes
 * is, by definition, not on it. `@cloudsforge/secrets` asserts the SHAPE of the value instead,
 * which is the property a placeholder cannot have. It is imported rather than copied so that this

 * 48 characters of the base64 alphabet carrying 36 bytes. The estate chose that command, so the
 * estate may demand its alphabet — that argument does not transfer to a value somebody else issues,
 * which is why `ANALYTICS_TOKEN` below takes the opaque rule instead.
 *
 * `assertGeneratedSecret` asserts what a placeholder cannot have: base64 or hex (no hyphens — every
 * placeholder this estate wrote had one), 32 decoded BYTES rather than 32 keystrokes, and a
 * measured Shannon entropy floor. The old `minLength = 32` parameter is gone rather than kept in
 * front of it: it is a strict subset of the shape check, and running it first answers a
 * 40-character placeholder with "must be at least 32 characters" — true, useless, and about the
 * wrong property.
 *
 * **CONSEQUENCE, STATED PLAINLY, BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE IN THIS CHANGE: the pepper
 * this estate is running is refused, so analytics will not boot until a real one is set — and the
 * placeholder CANNOT BE KEPT IN THE RING as `_V1` to preserve pre-rotation lookups, because the
 * guard refuses it under any version number.** That is the right answer even though it costs
 * something real. A pepper that was published in a compose file pseudonymises nothing: its lookup
 * keys are computable by anyone who can read the repository, so the rows derived under it were
 * never protected, and keeping it alive would buy erasure-reachability for data that has no privacy
 * property to protect. Retention prunes those rows; `subjectsBelowVersion` says when.
