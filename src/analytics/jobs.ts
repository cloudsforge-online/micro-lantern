/**
 * Background work.
 *
 * Rule 8 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: every background timer is a leased job. There is no `setInterval`
 * in this repository doing domain work, and CI greps for one
 * (`org/.github/workflows/service-ci.yml`).
 *
 * Each job is claimed `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` under a lease keyed `global`, so with N replicas
 * each tick runs exactly once. That matters more here than the rule alone suggests:
 *
 *   - **Retention deletes.** Two sweeps racing is survivable; two sweeps racing while a third
 *     replica is inserting is a long transaction holding row locks across the whole store.
 *   - **The rollup is an upsert on `(bucket_day, event_name)`.** Two workers recomputing the same
 *     day both write, and the loser's `count(distinct subject_key)` was taken at a different
 *     instant — so the published number depends on which transaction committed second.
 *   - **The cohort grid is a full recompute.** It is the most expensive query this service runs,
 *     and running it twice is the cheapest possible way to make the database the bottleneck.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **RETENTION IS A JOB THAT RUNS, NOT A DOCUMENTED INTENTION.**
 *
 * 11-data-and-contract-strategy.md gives analytics events four hundred days, and a retention
 * policy that lives only in a table in a document is a policy that has never deleted a row.
 * `jobs.test.ts` plants a row past the horizon, runs `sweepRetention`, and asserts the row is gone
 * — and asserts a row inside the horizon is still there, because a sweep that deletes everything
 * also passes a test that only checks the first half.
 *
 * The sweep also prunes `subject_keys`. A mapping row that outlives every event it names is a
 * pseudonym kept for no purpose, and this service's whole argument is that it holds nothing it
 * does not need.
