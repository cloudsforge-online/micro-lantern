/**
 * What this service is allowed to know.
 *
 * Two allowlists, and they are the whole privacy design at the ingest boundary:
 *
 *   1. **`EVENTS`** — which bus topics become which analytics event names. A topic that is not
 *      here produces no row at all.
 *   2. **`PROPERTIES`** — the only property names an event may carry, each with a *type*, and
 *      every type is closed. There is no `string` type. A property is an enum member, a short
 *      code, a bounded integer or a boolean, and nothing else.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THERE IS NO FREE-TEXT PROPERTY TYPE, AND THAT IS THE POINT.**
 *
 * A display name, a listing title, a search query or a chat line in an analytics payload is two
 * separate failures at once. It is a re-identification vector — "the user whose listing is called
 * *Spiros's 1994 Corolla*" is one person, whatever the subject column says — and it is a GDPR
 * erasure problem, because erasing the subject mapping does not erase a name written into a
 * property. 11-data-and-contract-strategy.md requires the ingest path to REJECT such a
 * key "rather than dropping the key silently"; a producer that sends one is told, in the response
 * to its own signed delivery, exactly which properties were refused.
 *
 * Closing the type system is what makes that structural rather than a review habit. A `string`
 * type with a length cap would still accept `"Spiros Savvanis"`; an enum whose members are listed
 * below cannot. `code` exists for the genuinely bounded machine identifiers — an asset code, a
 * chain name — and its pattern is short enough and narrow enough that no name, email or chain
 * address fits through it.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Money is a special case, stated twice in the estate and enforced here: amounts arrive
 * **bucketed** (`amount_bucket`), never exact. 13-operational-model.md fixes the buckets
 * at `<10, 10–100, 100–1k, 1k–10k, >10k` USD-equivalent, and 11:512 forbids an `amount` column
 * outright. Actual revenue comes from the ledger — 13-operational-model.md — never from here.
