/**
 * The versioned schema.
 *
 * Rule 7 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: versioned files, run by a one-shot job under an advisory lock,
 * expand/contract only. Nothing here is executed by `index.ts` — `src/migrator.ts` is the only
 * caller, and the service asserts the version rather than reaching it.
 *
 * **A released migration is immutable.** `@cloudsforge/db` checksums each one and refuses a run
 * where the text changed after it was applied. The fix for a wrong migration is always a new one.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE FOUR CONSTRAINTS THIS FILE EXISTS FOR.**
 *
 * Every other service in the estate holds data about a user because it must. This one holds data
 * about *behaviour, at volume, for analysis*, which is the shape that becomes a re-identification
 * incident. The privacy properties are therefore written as constraints rather than as code, on
 * the same principle that made `micro-devplatform`'s database refuse a fast hash and
 * `micro-ledger`'s refuse an unbalanced journal: an attacker with a database connection, and a
 * future code path nobody has written yet, are both stopped by the same line.
 *
 *   `events_subject_shape`        A subject column value must be 64 lowercase hex characters. A
 *                                 raw `user:<uuid>`, a bare UUID, an email and a handle are each
 *                                 refused BY THE DATABASE, so `INSERT INTO events` with a real
 *                                 identifier fails whoever runs it and whatever code path they
 *                                 found. AD-21, and 03-repository-responsibilities.md:204.
 *
 *   `events_person_has_pseudonym` A row for a person has a pseudonym, and a row for a machine has
 *                                 none — `(subject_kind in ('user','operator')) = (subject_key
 *                                 is not null)`. Both halves matter. Without the first, a bug that
 *                                 dropped the pseudonym would write an unattributable row into a
 *                                 funnel and quietly shrink every cohort. Without the second, a
 *                                 system event could be given a synthetic subject, which is how
 *                                 "distinct users" becomes a number nobody can explain.
 *
 *   `events_props_allowed`        Every property key is in the catalogue, no value is a nested
 *                                 object or array, and every string value matches a slug pattern
 *                                 with no spaces and no capitals. `"Spiros Savvanis"`,
 *                                 `"a@b.com"` and `"1994 Corolla — must go!"` are each refused by
 *                                 the database. 11-data-and-contract-strategy.md:509-515.
 *
 *   `subject_keys_erased`         Two legal states and no third: live, holding both salt and
 *                                 pseudonym, or erased, holding NEITHER. The database refuses a
 *                                 soft delete that keeps either half — and keeping the salt is the
 *                                 subtle one, because a salt plus the pepper plus the user id
 *                                 recomputes the pseudonym, so an "erasure" that kept it would
 *                                 have erased nothing. See `pseudonym.ts`.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * **There is no `user_id`, `email`, `handle`, `address` or `amount` column, anywhere.**
 * 11-data-and-contract-strategy.md:512 specifies that as a CI check — "a schema check in
 * `analytics`'s CI fails the build if a column named `user_id`, `email`, `handle`, `address` or
 * `amount` appears in any table". The estate's reusable workflow has no such check and this
 * repository ships no bespoke CI (03 §5), so it is `migrations.test.ts` instead, run against the
 * real migrated schema through `information_schema.columns`. It fails the build in the same place
 * and for the same reason, and it can see a column a grep over this file would miss.
 *
 * **Not partitioned.** 13-operational-model.md:655 says "append-only, partitioned monthly", and
 * that is the right answer at volume: retention becomes `DROP PARTITION` rather than a DELETE over
 * four hundred days of rows. It is deliberately not done yet, because declarative partitioning
 * forces the partition key into every unique constraint — `source_event_id` is the inbox's second
 * line of defence and would become `(occurred_at, source_event_id)`, which no longer refuses a
 * redelivery whose producer restamped the time. The retention sweep proves it deletes; the day the
 * DELETE is too slow is the day this becomes a migration, not before.

      -- ERASURE HAS TO REACH \`events.session\`, AND APPEND-ONLY SAID IT COULD NOT.
      --
      -- \`subject_keys_erased\` (migration 3) makes the salt destruction real, and the argument
      -- attached to it — after the salt is gone the events identify nobody — is true of
      -- \`subject_key\` and ONLY of \`subject_key\`.
      --
      -- \`session\` is a second identifier on the same rows, derived on a different path:
      -- HMAC(pepper, 'cf.analytics.session.v1|' || session_id), with no per-subject salt in it at
      -- all. Destroying the salt therefore does nothing to it. It stays deterministic under a
      -- pepper that can never be destroyed — the pepper keys every other subject in the table —
      -- so anyone holding the pepper and a candidate session id recomputes the digest and selects
      -- an "erased" person's rows directly; and even without the pepper, rows sharing a session
      -- re-cluster into one person's history. Recital 26 asks whether the data can be linked back
      -- to an individual, and a surviving session identifier is exactly such a link.
      --
      -- ── WHY THIS RELAXES APPEND-ONLY, AND HOW FAR ─────────────────────────────────────────
      --
      -- \`analytics_events_immutable\` existed so that "analytics computes, it does not correct":
      -- an event store whose rows can be rewritten is a record of what somebody last SAID
      -- happened. That argument is about CORRECTING A FACT, and it is still enforced below.
      --
      -- Clearing an identifier is not correcting a fact. Nothing about what happened, when, to
      -- what kind of subject, or under which event name changes; a link is removed. The exception
      -- is therefore made as narrow as it can be expressed rather than by dropping the trigger:
      --
      --   * only \`session\` may differ,
      --   * only from non-null to NULL — never to another value, so no row can be re-keyed,
      --   * every other column must be byte-identical.
      --
      -- The comparison is \`to_jsonb(new) - 'session'\` against the same of \`old\` rather than a
      -- list of column names on purpose: a column added by a later migration is covered by this
      -- rule automatically, where an enumerated list would silently stop protecting it.
      --
      -- This is the same move \`micro-community\` made for the same reason — its
      -- \`community_refuse_vote_update\` permits \`subject\` and \`cast_by\` to be rewritten by the
      -- erasure handler and refuses \`choice\`, \`weight\` and \`proposal_id\` outright — because
      -- refusing the whole UPDATE does not make the record safer, it makes erasure impossible
      -- without a DELETE, which is strictly worse.

      -- WHICH PEPPER MINTED THIS MAPPING (#189).
      --
      -- \`ANALYTICS_PSEUDONYM_KEY\` was published, so it has to be replaceable, and replacing it
      -- naively re-derives every returning subject to a NEW lookup key: one person becomes two
      -- pseudonyms, their history is orphaned, and erasure by subject stops reaching pre-rotation
      -- rows. That last one is a compliance regression, not a data-quality one.
      --
      -- The fix is a ring of peppers rather than a drain, and it cannot be a drain: \`lookup_key\`
      -- is HMAC(pepper, subject) and the raw subject is never stored — there is no user_id column,
      -- \`events_subject_shape\` refuses one, and HMAC does not run backwards. So old rows keep
      -- their old lookup key for ever and are found by deriving a candidate under every pepper
      -- held. See the rotation note at the top of src/pseudonym.ts.

      -- This column does not participate in that lookup. It exists to answer one operational
      -- question — WHEN MAY THE OLD PEPPER BE REMOVED — which is "when no live row is below the
      -- current version" (\`subjectsBelowVersion\`). Without it that question is unanswerable and
      -- an operator drops a pepper that rows still need, breaking erasure for them silently.

      -- single-pepper code, which is v1 by definition. It is not a guess.
