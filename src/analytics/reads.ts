/**
 * The analysis surface, and the threshold that stands in front of all of it.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **AN AGGREGATE OVER FEW PEOPLE IS A DISCLOSURE. A COHORT OF ONE IS THAT PERSON.**
 *
 * The pepper, the salt and the property allowlist all protect the *store*. None of them protects
 * the *answers*: "seven users in the 1k–10k bucket deposited on Tuesday" is a statement about
 * seven people, and "one user did" is a statement about one, whatever the subject column holds.
 * Anyone who knows one person registered on Tuesday reads that row and learns what they did.
 *
 * So every count this file returns passes `suppress()`, and every count below `minCohort` distinct
 * subjects comes back as `{ suppressed: true }` carrying **no number at all** — not a rounded one,
 * not a range, not "fewer than five". A rounded small count is still a small count, and "1–4"
 * combined with a second query is arithmetic.
 *
 * The threshold is five, and the reasoning is in the README. `env.ts` will let a deploy raise it
 * and refuses to let one lower it.
 *
 * **What this does not defend against, stated plainly:** differencing. An analyst who can run two
 * overlapping queries whose subject sets differ by one person can compute a suppressed cell from
 * two unsuppressed ones. Closing that needs a per-principal query budget, which is a bigger piece
 * of machinery than this service has, and it is recorded in the README rather than implied away.
 * What is closed here is the direct read — which is the one an operator reaches for by accident.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## Every count is of DISTINCT SUBJECTS, not of events
 *
 * Every metric in 13-operational-model.md §12 is phrased "users with at least one …", and the
 * distinction is load-bearing for suppression as well as for correctness: ten events from one
 * person and ten events from ten people are the same number of events and very different
 * disclosures. `events` is reported alongside, but the threshold is always applied to `subjects`.

 * `funnel` are all handed a `Window` — and the one place that did not (`retentionGrid`, which
 * anchored its cutoff on SQL `now()`) produced a test whose result depended on the day it ran.
 *
 * The failure is worth stating precisely, because the shape recurs. `date_trunc('week', …)` cuts on
 * a **Monday, in the session's timezone**. A fixture written as "three weeks ago, plus a day" keeps
 * the weekday of whatever day the suite runs on, so on one weekday the two timestamps share an ISO
 * week and on another they straddle the Monday boundary and land in different `week_offset`s. The
 * suite was green for three weeks and red on a Sunday — and, worse, green for the wrong reason in
 * between, since nothing in it ever checked that the offset was computed rather than assumed.
 *
 * A test cannot pin an instant it is not allowed to supply. So the instant is supplied. Production
 * passes nothing and gets the real clock; a test passes a fixed one and derives its fixture from
 * the same value, which is the only arrangement in which the fixture and the window it is asserted
 * against cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The type is `() => Date` rather than `() => number` to match the estate's prevailing seam —
 * `notify/src/pipeline.ts`, `runtime/packages/jobs/src/index.ts`, `foresight/src/jobs.ts`
